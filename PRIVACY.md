# Privacy Policy

### Last Updated: March 29, 2025

## Overview

Welcome to the Unofficial Star Realms Assistant ("the App") and MetaDeck service ("the Service"). This privacy policy is designed to help you understand how your personal information is handled when using our App and Service.

**The most important thing to know:** The Unofficial Star Realms Assistant is an open-source application that operates entirely on your device with no server communication. However, if you opt to use our MetaDeck service for statistics tracking and matchmaking, certain data will be transmitted to and stored on our servers as detailed in this policy.

## Information Collection

### Basic App Usage

When using only the basic Unofficial Star Realms Assistant app without MetaDeck features, **we do not collect any information**. All game statistics, settings, and other data you input into the App remain exclusively on your device.

The App uses local storage on your device to save:

- Game statistics and history
- User preferences and settings
- Card selection and game setup information

When using the mobile applications (Android/iOS), the App may collect certain device information such as:

- Device type and operating system version
- Application version and usage statistics
- Crash reports and performance data

This information is used solely for improving app performance and stability, and is not linked to personal identifiers unless you are using the MetaDeck service.

### MetaDeck Service

If you choose to use our MetaDeck service for statistics tracking and matchmaking, we collect and store the following information:

- Account identifiers (provided through Amazon Cognito authentication service)
- Game results and statistics
- Player performance metrics and ranking data
- Game preferences for matchmaking purposes
- Communication preferences

This data is collected and stored on our secure servers to provide the MetaDeck statistics tracking and matchmaking services. For authentication, we use Amazon Cognito, which means we do not store your password on our servers.

## Data Security

For the basic App, since all data remains on your device, the security of that data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system updated to ensure the best protection of any locally stored data.

For the MetaDeck service, we implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information:

- All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols
- Authentication is handled securely through Amazon Cognito, so we never store your passwords
- Regular security audits and updates to our systems
- Access controls to limit who can view or modify user data

While we implement these security measures, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We strive to protect your personal information but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Access

### Basic App

The basic App does not integrate with any third-party services that would have access to your data. Since no data leaves your device, no third parties can access your information through our App.

### MetaDeck Service

For the MetaDeck service, we may share certain data with the following third parties:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS), including Amazon Cognito for authentication services
- Cloud hosting providers to store and secure user data
- Analytics providers to help us improve our services
- Email service providers for account-related communications

We only share data necessary to provide the MetaDeck service and require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with applicable laws.

We do not sell your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.

## Your Rights

### Basic App Data

For the basic App, since we don't collect or store your data on our servers, there is no need for procedures to access, modify, or delete data from our systems. You can manage any locally stored data through your browser's settings.

## Children's Privacy

The App is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information in the basic App, there are no special provisions needed for children's privacy.

For the MetaDeck service, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us to have it removed.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may periodically update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices or to comply with new legal and operational requirements. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy.

## Open Source

The Unofficial Star Realms Assistant is an open-source project. You can review the source code on our repository to verify our privacy practices and how data is handled within the application.

## Mobile Application-Specific Terms

## Data Retention

For the basic App, data retention is controlled entirely by you, as all data remains on your device.

For the MetaDeck service, we retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the service. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes.

## International Data Transfers

The MetaDeck service may store and process your information in countries outside your country of residence. These countries may have different data protection laws.
